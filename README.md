## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your development machine.
- Access to a Slack workspace where you have the necessary permissions to create and manage Slack apps.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kyryloqaua/Testing-Slack-Bot-with-Jest.git
   ```

### Initializing Your Project

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Testing-Slack-Bot-with-Jest
   ```

3. Initialize your Node.js project:

   ```shell
   npm init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file for your project.

### Installing Dependencies

4. Install project dependencies, including the Slack Web API client and Jest for testing:

   ```shell
   npm install @slack/web-api jest --save
   ```

## Setting Up Your Slack App

### Creating a Slack App

1. Create a Slack app in your workspace by visiting [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).

### Configuring OAuth & Permissions

2. In your app's settings, under "OAuth & Permissions," add the necessary bot token scopes. Common scopes include:
   - `chat:write` for sending messages.
   - Additional scopes depending on your bot's functionality (e.g., `files:write`, `chat:schedule`, etc.).

### Generating a Bot Token

3. Under "OAuth & Permissions," install your app to your workspace to generate a bot token.

## Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

2. Add your Slack bot token to the `.env` file:

   ```shell
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
   ```

## Usage

### Starting Your Application

- Start your Node.js application:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

### Interacting with Slack

- Use the provided functions in `slackBot.js` to interact with the Slack API. You can add more functions as needed for your bot's functionality.

## Testing

- Run tests using Jest:

   ```shell
   npm test
   ```

## Deployment

- Deploy your Slack bot to a cloud service, such as Heroku, AWS, or Azure, to keep it running 24/7.

## Customization

### Adapting Functions

- You can customize the provided functions in `slackBot.js` to tailor your bot's behavior to your specific requirements.

### Implementing Features

- Implement additional features or interactions as needed for your Slack bot.

## Handling Slack API Responses

When working with the Slack API, you'll receive responses in JSON format. You can validate these responses in your code to ensure that your interactions with Slack are successful. Depending on the specific API method you call, the response format may vary.

- For example, when posting a message using `chat.postMessage`, you can check if the response contains an `ok` field with a value of `true` to confirm that the message was successfully sent.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like "An API error occurred: not_authed," it means there's an issue with your Slack bot's authentication. Make sure that the bot token in your `.env` file is correctly set and has the required scopes and permissions.

## Project Structure

- `slackBot.js`: Contains the functions for interacting with the Slack API.
- `slackBot.test.js`: Includes Jest tests for the functions in `slackBot.js`.
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and configuration.

## Additional Information

This README consolidates all the essential information for setting up your Slack bot. You can customize it to include any additional details specific to your project.

Happy bot building!
